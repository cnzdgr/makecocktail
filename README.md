## "Cocktail Recipes" Web Application (MERN Stack)

### Repo details
You may reach the deployed website at: https://makecocktail.net/
There may be some differences as this public repo is just a version of the private repo as of August 2023 and will not be updated. 

### Project details
It's a website that you may find cocktail recipes and also find cocktails you may make by selecting ingredients that you have.

"client" folder contains all frontend code, written in React using Tailwind CSS framework.
"server" folder contains all backend code, written in Node Express.
As Database, the project uses MongoDB Atlas. As I'm using the free tier, response time is weak.
I deployed using Google Cloud Platform.

Notes:
1. Cocktail database is currently too narrow. Therefore, usability of the website is not decent.
2. You may use this repo for educational purposes. For other purposes, please refer to the license file.
3. If you want to run the backend on your local environment, please check for the environmental variables (secrets) that are not committed to git.
