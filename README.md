## "Cocktail Recipes" Web Application (MERN Stack)

### Repo details
You can check the deployed website at: https://makecocktail.net/
There may be some differences as this public repo is just a version of the private repo as of August 2023 and will not be updated. 

### Project details
It's a web application that you may (i) find cocktail recipes, (ii) find cocktails you can prepare by selecting ingredients that you have.

"client" folder contains all the frontend code, written in React using Tailwind CSS framework.
"server" folder contains all the backend code, written in Node Express.
As Database, the project uses MongoDB Atlas. I'm using the free tier, so response time is not decent.
I deployed the project  on Google Cloud Platform.

Notes:
1. Cocktail database is currently narrow. Therefore, usability of the applicaiton is not decent.
2. You may use this repo for educational purposes. For other purposes, please refer to the license file.
3. If you want to run the backend on your local environment, please check for the environmental variables (secrets) that are not committed to git.
