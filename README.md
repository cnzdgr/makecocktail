# The project created by using MERN Stack

You may reach the deployed website (GCP): https://makecocktail.net/

It's a website that you may find cocktail recipes and also find cocktails you may make by selecting ingredients that you have.

"client" folder contains all frontend code, written in React using Tailwind CSS framework.
"server" folder contains all backend code, written in Node Express.
As Database, the project uses MongoDB Atlas. As I'm using the free tier, response time is not great.

Note1: Cocktail database is currently too narrow. Therefore, usability of the website is not decent.
Note2: You may use this repo for educational purposes. For other purposes, please refer to the license file.
